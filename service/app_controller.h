/**
 * @brief The AppController class is responsible for bringing all the back end server components
 * online and hooking them into a cohensive whole.  It's the puppet master - there is one of these
 * instantiated from main and its job is to run the circus.  With bells on.
 * 
 * The AppController will ensure that the publisher and messaging end points are allocated
 * the right ports, usually ephemeral but they can be fixed by command line parameters.  The port
 * numbers are then publishing using Bonjour.
 * 
 * The AppController will also run a USB hotplug controller in another thread - so that we can 
 * respond to plug events and attempt to instantiate the right USB code to take care of the
 * device that has been found (only if we know what the heck it is of course).
 * 
 * Devices that are recognized are give to the DeviceRegistry - its responsible for keeping tracking
 * of a unique ID per connected device, and for holding onto a pointer to both the libusb_device 
 * object and a piece of code that drives it - e.g. for iCharger 4010 DUO you'd expect to see a single
 * libusb_device* object as well as an instance of iCharger_DeviceController.
 * 
 * Devices that are removed will be instanty removed from the DeviceRegistry.
